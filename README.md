Rainfall Prediction with ML

Rainfall Prediction is one of the difficult and uncertain tasks that have a significant impact on human society. 
Project aims to predict rainfall using ML. Data preprocessing handles missing values, encodes categorical variables. Model training involves RandomForest with GridSearchCV for optimal parameters. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score assess model performance. Predictions are saved for further analysis.
Timely and accurate forecasting can proactively help reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.
